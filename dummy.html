    <h3>Reconciliation</h3>
        <p>
            Your Business Bank Statement should be reconciled towards your MYOB or Xero File every month to ensure that each transaction to go through your Bank account has also been included in your MYOB or XERO File. Bank reconciliation is a routine process that checks that all Business expenses have been allowed for i.e. Monthly Interest and Account keeping.
